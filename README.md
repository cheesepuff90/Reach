# Reach

Reach is a mobile application built as a group project by a team of four, aimed at empowering college students to share and access information about their colleges. The platform allows users to exchange insights on topics ranging from everyday college life to class difficulty and professor ratings, helping students make more informed decisions and connect with their peers.

## Project Overview

The primary problem we set out to solve is the lack of a centralized, student-driven space for sharing real experiences and advice about college life. While websites exist for official statistics and reviews, Reach provides a dynamic, peer-to-peer platform for authentic discussions and resource sharing.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native, Tailwind CSS (NativeWind)
- **Backend/Database:** Appwrite (cloud database and file storage)
- **Navigation & Routing:** Expo Router
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Media Handling:** Image and video uploads, previews, and storage via Appwrite

## Agile Methodology

This project was managed using the AGILE methodology, with regular planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to foster collaboration and flexibility within the team.
